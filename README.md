* Support for automatically rolling critical hits with targeted attacks (but currently only on nat20s, and doesn't handle called shots).
* Support for manually rolling critical hits, either by targeting a token and specifying damage type, and optionally attack bonus and called shot location, or by specifying the exact damage type, severity, and location
