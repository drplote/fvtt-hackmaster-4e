# hackmaster-4e
Adds some support for Hackmaster 4E rules to the OSRIC system.

### Current Features  
* Changes attributes bonuses to match Hackmaster rules rather than OSRIC.
* Adds ability to track armor damage.
* If using the Always HP add-on, adds armor and shield damage buttons to it.
* Automated armor damage if damage is targeted.
* Support for automatically rolling critical hits with targeted attacks (but currently only on nat20s, and doesn't handle called shots).
* Support for manually rolling critical hits, either by targeting a token and specifying damage type, and optionally attack bonus and called shot location, or by specifying the exact damage type, severity, and location.
* Tracking of damage over the course of a round to notify for threshold of pain.
* Honor stat added, as well as great honor and dishonor automatically adding to attack and damage rolls.
